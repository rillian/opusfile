opusfile (0.2+20130513-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Snapshot release for unstable.
  * Fixes the pkg-config file to avoid overlinking.  Closes: #707969
  * Split the URL handling into a separate library, so that linking with
    openssl is only an issue for people who do need that functionality.
    The main opusfile library can now be linked with anything again.
    Closes:  #708008
